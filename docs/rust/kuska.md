# Kuska SSB Rust implementation

## Introduction

[Kuska-ssb](https://github.com/Kuska-ssb) implements a subset of the existing Javascript functionality. The majority of the code lives in the [ssb](https://github.com/Kuska-ssb/ssb) repository, with a separate [handshake](https://github.com/Kuska-ssb/handshake) repository containing the Secure Scuttlebutt handshake and boxstream library.

If you are not familiar with the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), please visit the [Getting started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) page to learn more. The [Rust programming language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) are both excellent learning guides.
